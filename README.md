# CNN_Image_Classification
This project uses a CNN to extract feature vectors from images and cluster them with KMeans. Images are resized, preprocessed, and converted into embeddings that capture visual characteristics. Clustering groups similar images, enabling easy organization and analysis of the dataset.
